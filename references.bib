    abstract="This chapter maps the structure of the empirical input--output representations of actual economies, i.e. the Supply and Use Tables and the Symmetric Input--Output Tables, and critically evaluates the methods that have been proposed to convert the former into the latter. It is argued that (i) all conversion methods rest on the groundless assumption that single production, and not joint production, characterizes the economic structure of the real world; and (ii) a consistent approach is the straightforward treatment of the Supply and Use Tables on the basis of general joint production models inspired by the von Neumann and Sraffa contributions.",
